## Tasks for DevOps

Download the `tar` file from the releases first. It is under release `v0.0.1`

##### Task 1

Make a `bash` script, which does the following tasks in this order

- Unzip the `.gz` file
- Delete all the `pycache files`.
- Remove the comments in all the files present. And by comments we mean `python` comments
- Replace the occurence of the word **Tasdik Rahman** in all the files with **Your name**

##### Task 2

You are given a log file inside inside the `logs` directory.

Write a script which parses the log file for the date `Jan 21` in a line and then in that line searches for the words

- `ERROR`
- `SUCCESS`
- `INFO`

and store(append) those lines into seperate files. i.e a line with `ERROR` should be stored in the file `error.txt` and so on. 

##### Task 3
